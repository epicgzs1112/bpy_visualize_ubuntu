# Visualizing 3D Data with Blender in Python

This repository contains various Python scripts for visualizing 3D data,
in the form of triangular meshes, point clouds or occupancy grids,
using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)'s [Python API](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/).

## Requirements

The code was tested with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) 2.78 or higher.
Python should be installed locally and should also ship Python 3.5 with
a custom NumPy installation.

All remaining requirements, essentially [dimatura/binvox-rw-py](https://github.com/dimatura/binvox-rw-py)
and [alextsui05/blender-off-addon](https://github.com/alextsui05/blender-off-addon)
are included.

## File Formats

The following file formats are assumed:

* [OFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OFF_(file_format)): file format for triangular meshes.
* [BINVOX](http://www.patrickmin.com/binvox/): file format for occupancy grids.
* A custom TXT format for point clouds.

The provided OFF files can be visualized using [MeshLab](http://www.meshlab.net/).
Scripts for converting OBJ files to OFF files as well as writing BINVOX and TXT files
are provided.

The custom TXT file format looks as follows:

    n_points
    p1_x p1_y p2_z
    p2_x p2_y p2_z
    ...

Use the following Python scripts for conversion:

* `off_to_obj.py` and `obj_to_off.py` to conversion between OFF and OBJ.
* `txt_to_ply.py` to convert a TXT point cloud to PLY format.

Examples of using the included Python code for writing TXT or BINVOX files
are provided in `write_txt.py` and `write_binvox.py`.

## Examples

`examples/` includes some examples; these should be rune out of the root folder:

    ./examples/render_off.sh
    ./examples/render_binvox.sh
    ./examples/render_txt.sh

All examples create `examples/0.png`.

## Usage

The provided examples essentially use the functionality provided in `blender_utils.py`;
the general approach is as follows:

    # Import utils.
    from blender_utils import *
    
    # Initialize and set camera target.
    # Check the function to adapt the light sources or camera(s).
    camera_target = initialize()
    
    # Create a material.
    # First parameter is the name, second is the diffuse color in rgb,
    # third argument is the alpha channel and last whether to cast/receive shadow.
    off_material = make_material('BRC_Material_Mesh', (0.66, 0.45, 0.23), 0.8, True)

    # Load an OFF file, alternatively, use load_binvox or load_txt.
    # In any case, we need the previously defined material.
    # The mesh provided in examples/0.off is scaled to [0,32]^3,
    # so we scale it by 1/32 = 0.03125 and then translate it to the
    # origin using (-0.5, -0.5, -0.5).
    # Finally we switch y and z axes.
    load_off(args.off, off_material, (-0.5, -0.5, -0.5), 0.03125, 'xzy')

    # Set rotation of camera around the origin, implicitly defines the locatio
    # together with the distance.
    rotation = (5, 0, -55)
    distance = 0.5
    
    # Render all loaded objects using the camera_target obtained above and
    # the output file.
    render(camera_target, output_file, rotation, distance)
